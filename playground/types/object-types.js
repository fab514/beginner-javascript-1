// The Object class represents one of JavaScript's data types. It is used to store various keyed 
// collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object() constructor or the 
// object initializer / literal syntax.


console.log('object here');
// Object (person) with sub-variables

const person = {
  first: 'felicia',
  last: 'brenner',
  age: 100,
};
// We will continue to learn objects at a later time.
