    // An array is used for holding a list of items where the order matters. 
    // Each entry in an array is called an item. The position of the array item is called an index. 
    // The number of items in array is called the length. The items in an array can be any type. 
    // An array is not it's own type, It is a type of object that has methods inside of it.
    
    // To check if something is an array, type in the console Array.isArray(names) - it will retun true or false. 
    const names = ['wes', 'kait', 'snickers', 'last one!']; // array literal
    console.log(names[0]); // items are 0 based, the first item is considered 0
    console(name.length);
    console.log(names[names.length - 1]); // Will give you access to the last item of the array. Because the length will show the amount of items but we want the item number to start from 0 
    
    names.push('lux'); // Is a mutible method.
    console.log(names);
    const names2 = [...names, 'lux']; // Used to stop the mutible method from changing the array.
    names.unshift('poppy'); // Will move 'poppy' to the front of the array. 
    const name3 = ['poppy', ...names]; // will move 'poppy' to the front of the array without changing the original. 
    
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

    numbers.splice(3, 2); // Splice is mutable. In this example it will take out the numbers 4 and 5 because it starts from the 3rd Item and takes out 2 items. 
    // You would usually like to use slice instead of splice. 

    // Prototype within the array, shown in the console will show the many methods you can use with an array. 

    
    // Mutible methods, perform mutatation, when something changes the original version of it. 
    // Inmutible methods will not change the orginal just return a new version of the array. 
    // Mutation Method- reverse
    // Anytime you want to use a method mutation and NOT mutate the original array
    // We need to make a copy of the array

    // const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
    // const numbersReversed = [...numbers].reverse();
    
    // // numbers.reverse();
    // console.log(numbers); // Original array has also been changed. 

    // // immutable-slice
    // const pizzaSlice = numbers.slice(2, 4); // Takes out the chunk of the array without changing the original data.
